BUILD
=====

a [Makefile to build](build/) Symfony2-based web apps

Deploy
======

a [Makefile to deploy](/deploy) web apps on a released-based dirs structure


Simple philosophy
=================

- Keep the build/deployement simple & fast.
- Use Make, available on UNIX / GNU Linux / FreeBSD / Mac OS X
- And or change your rulesets & tools, freely without changing your build/deployement command: just `make`, as always
- Rollbacking is as simple as deploying: `make rollback`
- In case of doubt: `make help`
